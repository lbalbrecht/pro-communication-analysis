## Description

Bootcamp Project 1: A language-analysis application for professional communications

Emails are an integral part of professional and business operations; however, a significant amount of subtext is lost in a written message, particularly the tone of the message itself. This can present challenges when an employee unintentionally sends an email that the recipient could interpret negatively or combatively.

Google Cloud Natural Language is an API that analyzes language and provides information about the perceived tone of the message through a machine-learning-derived understanding of colloquial speech.
